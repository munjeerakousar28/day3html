        <h3>MAKKAH</h3>
        <p>Makkah is generally considered "the fountainhead and cradle of 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" title="wikipedia Islam" target="_blank" > Islam</a>". 
         Mecca is revered in Islam as the birthplace of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad"
         title="wikipedia Muhammad" target="_blank" > Islamic prophet Muhammad</a>. 
         The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkah" title="wikipedia hira" target="_blank" > Hira</a>
         cave atop the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jabal_al-Nour" target="_self" >Jabal al-Noor</a> 
         ("Mountain of Light"), just outside the city, is where Muslims believe the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quran"
         target="_blank" >Quran</a> was first revealed to Muhammad. Visiting Mecca for the á¸¤ajj is an obligation 
         upon all able Muslims. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makkah"title="wikipedia mosque" target="_blank" > 
         Great Mosque of Mecca</a>, known as the Masjid al-Haram, is home to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaaba" 
         title="wikipedia kabah" target="_blank"> Ka'bah</a>,believed by Muslims to have been built by 
         <a href="https://www.islamic-relief.org.uk/giving/islamic-giving/qurbani/prophet-ibrahim-as-and-his-sacrifice/" 
         target="_blank" > Ibrahim</a> Ishmael and  It is Islam's holiest site and the direction of prayer 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qibla" title="wikipedia qibla" target="_blank" > (qibla)</a> 
         for all Muslims worldwide.<hr></p>
        <p>Muslim rulers from in and around the region long tried to take the city and keep it in their control, 
         and thus, much like most of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz" title="wikipedia Hejaj" target="_self" >
         Hejaz</a> region, the city has seen several regime changes. The city was most 
         recently conquered in the Saudi conquest of Hejaz by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ibn_Saud" 
         title="saud" target="_self" >Ibn Saud</a> and his allies in 1925. Since then, Mecca has seen a tremendous
         expansion in size and infrastructure, with newer, modern buildings such as the 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Clock_Towers"  target="_blank" >Abraj Al Bait</a>, 
         the world's fourth-tallest building and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_largest_buildings" 
         target="_blank" > third-largest by floor area,</a> towering over the Great Mosque.<hr><br>
         The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam" title="Saudi govt" target="_blank" > Saudi government</a>
         has also carried out the destruction of several historical structures and archaeological 
         sites, such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ajyad_Fortress" 
         title="wikipedia forest" target="_blank" >Ajyad Fortress</a> However, many of the 
         demolitions have officially been part of the continued expansion of the 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masjid_al-Haram" title="wikipedia Haram" target="_blank" > Masjid al-Haram</a> 
         at Mecca and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet%27s_Mosque" target="_blank" > Prophet's Mosque 
         in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medina" title="wikipedia madina" target="_blank" >Madina</a> and their 
         auxiliary service facilities in order to accommodate the ever-increasing number of Muslims performing the pilgrimage 
         <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hajj" title="wikipedia hajj" target="_blank" > (hajj)</a>. Non-Muslims are 
         strictly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closed_city" target="_self" > prohibited from entering the city.</a><hr></p>
